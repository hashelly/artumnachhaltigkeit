<b>Official invitation for the 2nd session of the Sustainability Student Initiatives Forum (SSIF)<b>

Date: November 3rd, 2021
Time: 7 pmRegistration link:  https://wiki.tum.de/display/sustainabilityforms/Register+for+the+Sustainability+Student+Initiatives+Forum 
(please register each participant separately so that we get a good overview of the number of people!) 
 
Dear sustainable student initiatives,
As announced in our last e-mail, we are very happy if you participate again. New members are also very welcome!

<b>Program: In the 2nd session we will focus on good meetings, recruiting new members and funding.<b>
* How to make good meetings online? The SSIF will serve as a real lab and we will try out which tools work well or not so well.
* How to recruit and hold new members for your initiative during Corona? We share our best practices and ideas.
* What is the challenge with funding? We want to tackle the funding block: gather your needs, work out a roadmap together and assign tasks for next time.
* Funding: In the first SSIF meeting we realized that funding is an important topic for the initiatives and we want to take it up in the future. Unfortunately, we as the Sustainability Office do not have a corresponding budget at the moment and so far we do not have a comprehensive overview of the possibilities that exist at TUM. Therefore, we want to develop this knowledge together with you over the next few meetings.
* Virtual drink - finally, after-work mood again! Grab a drink of your choice and let's end the evening in a cozy atmosphere.

<b>The roadmap<b>
* Register via the link. Please register each participating person separately!
* Registration deadline is 1.11.2021 at 23:59
* You will receive the zoom link with the confirmation email after registration.
* Save the date (.ics file is attached to this mail)
* Join SSIF Telegram Group: https://t.me/joinchat/svWNYpwPFUo5MzJi
